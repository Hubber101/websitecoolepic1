1. You can invade a nation, but first you must make a 5 or more on a d20 roll.<br>
     1.5. If you roll a 20, you get a 2x chance of your strategy working.<br>
<br>
2. To invade a nation, you need to come up with a strategy. When you have a strategy, submit a form or @ me with the strategy and the person you'd like to invade.<br>
<br>
3. This also applies to alliances, however the team you're trying to ally with must also land a d20 roll, and can decline/cancel the alliance at any time.<br>
<br>
4. Nations can defend or counterattack invasions, but they must respond within an hour and have a "better scored" strategy. The strategy is scored /100 by the AI bot. If they don't respond within an hour, a "ghost" invasion can begin, where the attack is treated as a sneak attack to the AI. In this case, the opponent can respond at any point and start a counterattack, basically "re-doing" the invasion with both players active. However, the player counterattacking late will have a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
5. If a response is given within an hour, the victim and the invader both roll a d100. If the victim rolls higher, the invasion fails and the opposer must wait a day to make another invasion on the same person. If the invader rolls higher, the invasion begins normally with strategies given to the AI from both players.<br>
<br>
6. You can only invade an area if it is adjacent to an area under your control. Otherwise, you must have another way to get your soldiers and colonizers to the area.<br>

There are various "actions" you can take. Taking them has different requirements like land, research points, power, respect, etc. These are measured by Nicholas and the AI bot.<br>
<br>
Actions include:<br>
Making weapons (land + research points)<br>
Making inventions (facility space + research points, gained respect + power)<br>
Starting wars (weapons, gained land, money, respect (if you win), lost land, money, respect (if you lose))<br>
Making misc. things, such as your own inventions (research + facility space, gained power)
